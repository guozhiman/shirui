  <div align="left"><b>VERIFYING THE SELF-ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE</b></div>
<div align="left">In completing the Self-Assessment Process, the following lists each question from the Self-</div>
<div align="left">Assessment Questionnaire and the evidence that must be verified.</div>
<div align="left"><b>PERSONNEL ISSUES</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 1.1 Does the factory obtain current information on local and national laws and</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>regulations, and incorporate this information in its business practices?</b></div>
<div align="left">The workers should be compensated according to the local and national labor laws. The payroll</div>
<div align="left">department should have the latest copies of these laws and amendments on file. These laws should</div>
<div align="left">cover, but not be limited to the following areas:</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Wages and hours.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Legal benefits.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Minimum age for employment and related restrictions.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Health and safety standards.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Employment discrimination.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; General labor law.</div>
<div align="left">The factory should have a procedure that will ensure that the labor laws and regulations are being</div>
<div align="left">followed. There should be a manager or supervisor responsible for monitoring and updating these</div>
<div align="left">laws. Any new laws should be adapted as soon as possible.</div>
<div align="left">The factory should review the labor laws to ensure that the workers are being properly compensated.</div>
<div align="left">If the factory uncovers a violation, that violation must be corrected as soon as possible. The factory</div>
<div align="left">should document the violation and what was done to correct it. There should be a procedure to</div>
<div align="left">prevent the violation from re-occurring.</div>
<div align="left">It should be part of the factories official company policy that all labor laws will be obeyed.</div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 1.2 Does the factory prohibit any condition within the facility, building and/or</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>equipment that could cause injury or death to the workers, or any violation of law or a</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>JCPenney standard?</b></div>
<div align="left">An unsafe condition is anything that can cause injury or death to the worker. The factory should have</div>
<div align="left">a procedure for monitoring safety conditions within the facility. This would include the building and all</div>
<div align="left">property that is attached to the building and owned, or used by the factory. There should also be a</div>
<div align="left">procedure for monitoring equipment and machinery for unsafe conditions. These procedures should</div>
<div align="left">be monitored by a manager or supervisor. This can be anyone that the factory designates, however,</div>
<div align="left">it is usually the responsibility of the Safety Manager or Safety Supervisor. Safety issues concerning</div>
<div align="left">machinery and equipment are usually monitored by an Equipment Maintenance Manager or</div>
<div align="left">Supervisor.</div>
<div align="left">The building should be inspected on a regular basis for unsafe conditions. Unsafe conditions should</div>
<div align="left">be repaired as soon as possible. Building inspection records should be maintained indicating the</div>
<div align="left">type of inspection performed, date of the inspection and the results of the inspection. Any repairs</div>
<div align="left">made should also be listed.</div>
<div align="left">Machinery and equipment should be inspected and maintained on a regular basis. Defective</div>
<div align="left">machinery and equipment should not be used until the proper repairs have been made. Equipment</div>
<div align="left">inspection records should be maintained listing the type of inspection, date of the inspection, the</div>
<div align="left">results of the inspection and what repairs were made. Any repairs made should also be listed.</div>
<div align="left">All workers using any machinery or equipment should be properly trained in the safe use of the</div>
<div align="left">equipment involved.</div>
<div align="left">All local and national laws concerning labor issues and the operation of the factory must be obeyed.</div>
<div align="left">However, there are situations where a JCPenney standard is more stringent than local or national</div>
<div align="left">law. When this occurs, the JCPenney standard must be followed.</div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 1.3 Does the factory effectively prohibit convict, involuntary, and forced labor?</b></div>
<div align="left">The use of convict, involuntary, indentured or forced labor of any kind is prohibited. There are no</div>
<div align="left">exceptions.</div>
<div align="left">Convict Labor</div>
<div align="left">The factory is prohibited from hiring convicted criminals currently in prison for committing a crime.</div>
<div align="left">Even though there are conditions where it is permitted to employ criminals under local or national law,</div>
<div align="left">it is expressly forbidden to import any product into the United States under United Stated Customs</div>
<div align="left">Laws, if that product was produced by convict labor.</div>
<div align="left">Involuntary Labor or Forced Labor</div>
<div align="left">Anyone being forced to work against their will is considered involuntary or forced labor. Workers</div>
<div align="left">must be given complete freedom of movement to leave the facility at any time. Factories have the</div>
<div align="left">right to impose restrictions on workers entering the facility or entering certain rooms within the facility</div>
<div align="left">but should never prohibit workers from leaving.</div>
<div align="left">Indentured Labor</div>
<div align="left">Workers should never be forced to work by contract or any other means. Workers should never be</div>
<div align="left">forced to work to pay off a debt for themselves, a family member or anyone else by signing a</div>
<div align="left">contract.</div>
<div align="left">Worker Contracts</div>
<div align="left">In some factories workers are required to sign an employment contract. These contracts will usually</div>
<div align="left">list the job description, job duties, disciplinary procedures, overtime requirements and the length of</div>
<div align="left">time that the contract is in effect. Some contracts are open ended. That is, the contract may be</div>
<div align="left">written with no ending date. If the contract is open ended, there must be a provision that will end the</div>
<div align="left">contract when the worker resigns the job. Employment contracts must not include anything that can</div>
<div align="left">be interpreted as forcing the worker to work. Workers must be allowed to resign at any time.</div>
<div align="left">Occasionally factories use third party agents or brokers to hire workers. If third parties are used to</div>
<div align="left">hire workers, the workers&rsquo; wages must be paid directly to the worker and not the agency or broker. It</div>
<div align="left">is the factories responsibility to ensure that third party agents or brokers supply legal workers that are</div>
<div align="left">not convicts, indentured or forced to work in any way.</div>
<div align="left">Security guards employed by the factory, or security agencies contracted for their services, must not</div>
<div align="left">engage in practices that will cause workers to stay in the factory and work against their will. Security</div>
<div align="left">guards should be limited to normal security functions such as protecting the factory and products</div>
<div align="left">produced and the security of the workers and other factory personnel.</div>
<div align="left">The factory should not retain the worker's original identification card, work permit or other form of</div>
<div align="left">identification.</div>
<div align="left">Employees must have freedom of movement within the dormitories and be free to leave at any time.</div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 1.4 Does the factory obtain documentation for proof of age and eligibility for</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>employment from all potential workers prior to hiring?</b></div>
<div align="left">When hiring workers, the factory should verify proof of age and eligibility to work according to local</div>
<div align="left">and national laws or JCPenney standards. This proof must be in a form of legally acceptable</div>
<div align="left">documents. The following are examples of the type of documents that are acceptable:</div>
<div align="left">Proof of age as required by the country where the factory is located, including but not limited to:</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Official birth certificate.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Official identification card.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Official school records.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Proof of residence.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Immigration or other legal papers as required.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; A statement of age containing:</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Employee signature.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Employee identification number or other means of identification.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Date of signature.</div>
<div align="left">All workers should fill out an employment application listing their name, address, date of birth, place</div>
<div align="left">of birth, citizenship, type of job applied for and any information as required by local and national law.</div>
<div align="left">This application should be signed by the worker.</div>
<div align="left">The factory should have a procedure that explains to the workers minimum age and eligibility</div>
<div align="left">requirements for the job applied for. The factory should explain all benefits that the workers are</div>
<div align="left">entitled to. This includes social security (medical and pension), savings, bonus, overtime hours,</div>
<div align="left">overtime pay, worker contracts, job requirements, disciplinary procedures, dormitory, meals and</div>
<div align="left">anything that will affect the worker.</div>
<div align="left">All benefits and requirements should be prominently posted so they can be read by all the workers.</div>
<div align="left">All worker personnel records should be periodically reviewed to ensure that the proper documents are</div>
<div align="left">on file and correctly updated.</div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 1.5 Does the factory prohibit the hiring of workers under the legal age or</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>JCPenney standard, or ineligible workers, and does the factory keeps copies of age and</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>eligibility?</b></div>
<div align="left">It is the responsibility of the factory to ensure that all workers hired are of legal age and meet the</div>
<div align="left">eligibility requirements of the country where the factory is located. If it is determined that these</div>
<div align="left">requirements are below the JCPenney standards, then the JCPenney standards will apply.</div>
<div align="left">The factory should have a procedure to screen all workers prior to hiring, to ensure that they meet all</div>
<div align="left">applicable age and eligibility requirements. Copies of all applicable proof should be kept on file for all</div>
<div align="left">workers.</div>
<div align="left">There should be a manager or supervisor responsible for maintaining and updating worker files.</div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 1.6 Does the factory effectively prohibit all forms of harassment, abuse, and</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>physical and/or verbal abuse?</b></div>
<div align="left">Workers should be fairly treated according to the laws of the country where the factory is located.</div>
<div align="left">The factory should expressly prohibit all forms of harassment, verbal and/or physical abuse. This</div>
<div align="left">includes, but is not limited to:</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Physical or verbal coercion.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Sexual abuse.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Harassment, or abuse in the form of disciplinary action.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Any harassment or abuse from any person, such as security guards, or any manager, supervisor</div>
<div align="left">or worker.</div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 1.7 Does the factory have procedures to ensure employees are compensated</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>in accordance with local laws and regulations?</b></div>
<div align="left">The factory should have a payroll procedure that will ensure workers are compensated in accordance</div>
<div align="left">with local and national laws. The factory should have a manager or supervisor responsible for the</div>
<div align="left">payment of wages and all issues relating to wages. There should be an itemized listing of all</div>
<div align="left">deductions. These procedures should include, but not be limited to:</div>
<div align="left">&bull; A detailed method of payment as appropriate.</div>
<div align="left">Check.</div>
<div align="left">Cash.</div>
<div align="left">Direct deposit.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; The basis for payment.</div>
<div align="left">Hourly.</div>
<div align="left">Weekly.</div>
<div align="left">Monthly.</div>
<div align="left">Piece rate.</div>
<div align="left">Combination (Hourly and piece rate).</div>
<div align="left">&bull; A detailed procedure for wage calculation where applicable.</div>
<div align="left">Quota for piece rate or hourly calculation.</div>
<div align="left">Adjustment to meet minimum.</div>
<div align="left">Hourly or monthly minimum rate.</div>
<div align="left">Bonus or other incentives.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Itemized deductions.</div>
<div align="left">Social Security (Medical and/or pension).</div>
<div align="left">Required local and national taxes.</div>
<div align="left">Issuing and repayment of loans.</div>
<div align="left">Any other deductions.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Frequency of payment.</div>
<div align="left">Weekly.</div>
<div align="left">Monthly.</div>
<div align="left">Other.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Specific length of the normal work day.</div>
<div align="left">Number of hours.</div>
<div align="left">Start and finish time.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Define the normal week.</div>
<div align="left">Number of consecutive days.</div>
<div align="left">Specific days of the week.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Rest and meal breaks.</div>
<div align="left">Number of breaks.</div>
<div align="left">Length of break.</div>
<div align="left">Time of day or shift.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Designate days off.</div>
<div align="left">Normal day(s) off each week.</div>
<div align="left">Holidays (Legal and/or religious).</div>
<div align="left">Vacation.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Define overtime.</div>
<div align="left">Hours.</div>
<div align="left">Compensation rate.</div>
<div align="left">The factory should have a detailed pay slip that shows all the deductions made and the method of</div>
<div align="left">calculation. If workers receive cash payments there should be a master payroll record with each</div>
<div align="left">workers&rsquo; signature indicating that they received their pay.</div>
<div align="left">The workers should be notified in writing of any changes in their actual pay and/or payroll procedures</div>
<div align="left">and the reasons for these changes.</div>
<div align="left">Any miscalculations or under payment of wages must be corrected immediately.</div>
<div align="left">Any worker's complaints regarding wages must be investigated immediately. If it is determined that</div>
<div align="left">the workers were not correctly paid, an adjustment must be made immediately.</div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 1.8 Are factory workers, at the time of hiring, made aware of their legal rights</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>regarding hours worked, and wage compensation?</b></div>
<div align="left">When factory workers are hired they should receive an explanation of their legal rights concerning the</div>
<div align="left">working hours of the factory. They should be told if overtime is required and how many overtime</div>
<div align="left">hours they can expect to work daily, weekly and monthly. They should be given an explanation of the</div>
<div align="left">laws concerning overtime.</div>
<div align="left">A written explanation of wage and overtime laws should be provided to the workers. This explanation</div>
<div align="left">should be signed by the worker and a copy should be kept in the worker&rsquo;s file.</div>
<div align="left">The factory should periodically review the laws concerning hours worked and wage compensation to</div>
<div align="left">ensure they are in compliance with the most current laws. Any areas that are not current should be</div>
<div align="left">corrected. Copies of the latest laws should be kept on file.</div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 1.9 Does the factory prominently post minimum wage rates, allowance</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>information, benefits policies, and regular and overtime wages in the native language(s) of the</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>factory workers and management personnel?</b></div>
<div align="left">The factory should list its policies concerning minimum wage rates, regular working hours, overtime</div>
<div align="left">hours and benefits. Any applicable local and national wage laws should also be listed. These</div>
<div align="left">postings should be located in prominent areas, i.e., the worker entrance, time clock, or cafeteria; so</div>
<div align="left">the workers can read them at any time.</div>
<div align="left">All postings should be in the native language of the factory workers and factory management</div>
<div align="left">personnel. In the event that the factory hires workers that speak a language other than the language</div>
<div align="left">of the country where the factory is located, these postings should also be in that language. It is</div>
<div align="left">possible that the factory will need postings in more than one language.</div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 1.10 Does the factory have, utilize, and maintain an organized payroll system</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>including an accurate time recording device?</b></div>
<div align="left">The payment of wages can be a complicated process. To ensure that the workers are accurately</div>
<div align="left">paid, an organized payroll system should be used. A computer payroll system is recommended for</div>
<div align="left">accuracy and consistency. All methods of payment, including time work, piece work, incentives,</div>
<div align="left">bonus, and etc., should be part of the payroll system. All benefits and allowances such as meals,</div>
<div align="left">housing, uniforms, etc., should be included. All deductions such as social security (medical and</div>
<div align="left">pension), taxes, loans, and etc., should also be included.</div>
<div align="left">If the factory is not equipped for an organized or automated payroll system, a commercial payroll</div>
<div align="left">service, if available, is an acceptable alternative.</div>
<div align="left">For piece rate and/or quota payments, employee sign-off sheets should be available confirming the</div>
<div align="left">correct unit counts. The employee should sign off on any random re-counts that are used for</div>
<div align="left">verification.</div>
<div align="left">Since accurate payroll calculations are based on the time that the factory workers work, an accurate</div>
<div align="left">time recording device such as an electric or electronic time clock should be used. The time clock</div>
<div align="left">should be periodically checked for accuracy. Each worker should have their own time card to record</div>
<div align="left">time in and time out including meal breaks and rest breaks. If an electronic recording device is used,</div>
<div align="left">each worker should have a worker identification card to record time in/time out, meal breaks and rest</div>
<div align="left">breaks. The factory should maintain a summary sheet listing the time worked for all the workers.</div>
<div align="left">The factory should perform periodic reviews to determine the accuracy for the method of paying the</div>
<div align="left">workers. Mechanical and electronic equipment should be checked to ensure that it is in proper</div>
<div align="left">working order. If this equipment is found to be inaccurate, or not in working order, corrective action</div>
<div align="left">should be taken, including adjustment of back wages, if required, for the period of time when the</div>
<div align="left">equipment malfunctioned.</div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 1.11 Does the factory produce and retain payroll records to support</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>compensation, including the payment of overtime and the deduction or required taxes?</b></div>
<div align="left">The factory should keep payroll records for at least one year or longer if required by law. Payroll</div>
<div align="left">summaries should also be retained with the following information:</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Name and identification number of each employee.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Hourly, weekly, monthly rate or piece rate if applicable.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Payment of minimum wage.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Gross pay.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Net pay.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Pay period.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Payment date.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Minimum wage.</div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 1.12 Does the factory provide all employees with pay information which details</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>the current period's wage calculation?</b></div>
<div align="left">The factory should provide each worker with a pay stub or some other form of documentation listing</div>
<div align="left">the details for the pay period involved. This information should include, but not be limited to:</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Total hours worked including regular and overtime hours.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Gross wages including advances or loans.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Calculation of overtime, quota incentive and piece rate if applicable.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Make up pay for piece rate under the minimum wage.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Social Security, pension, savings.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Other deductions including repayment of loans.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Net Pay.</div>
<div align="left">The factory should periodically interview workers, selected at random, to verify that they have</div>
<div align="left">examined a detailed pay record and that they understand the calculation of their gross pay and net</div>
<div align="left">pay. Any deviations from the established procedures are to be corrected in a timely manner.</div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 1.13 Does the factory pay piece rate workers at a rate equivalent to the minimum</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>wage required by law?</b></div>
<div align="left">The factory must ensure that all workers earn the minimum rate according to law. If a piece rate</div>
<div align="left">worker cannot make the standard, the factory must adjust the standard of the wage rate so that the</div>
<div align="left">workers wage will be equal to the legal minimum wage. The worker should be advised of this and the</div>
<div align="left">payroll records should reflect this adjustment.</div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 1.14 Does the factory ensure that the workers do not work more hours per day</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>and per week than the legal limits, or the JCPenney standard?</b></div>
<div align="left">There are times when it is necessary for a factory to work overtime to meet production and delivery</div>
<div align="left">schedules. However, workers who work excessive hours will loose efficiency and production will</div>
<div align="left">decrease. In addition, the injury rate will increase.</div>
<div align="left">Workers must not exceed the maximum number of hours allowed by law or the JCPenney standard.</div>
<div align="left">In the event that there is no local or national law governing maximum working hours or current law is</div>
<div align="left">in conflict with the JCPenney standard, then the JCPenney standard will apply.</div>
<div align="left">If the factory determines that it is necessary to work more hours then allowed by law, they must</div>
<div align="left">obtain a waiver from the appropriate governing authority. This waiver must list the period time</div>
<div align="left">covered and the amount of hours to be worked. Workers must be paid for extra overtime according</div>
<div align="left">to local or national law.</div>
<div align="left">The department or individual responsible for payroll must perform periodic time card reviews to</div>
<div align="left">ensure the hours worked by employees (voluntarily or involuntarily) in a given day, week or month do</div>
<div align="left">not exceed legal limits. If official waivers have been issued, the limits of the waiver must not be</div>
<div align="left">exceeded.</div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 1.15 Does the factory have policies that explicitly prohibit discrimination?</b></div>
<div align="left">The factory must hire workers based on their ability to do the job not on any physical or personal</div>
<div align="left">characteristics or beliefs.</div>
<div align="left">The factory must have a policy that expressly prohibits all forms of discrimination. The workers must</div>
<div align="left">be made aware of this policy.</div>
<div align="left"><b>HEALTH AND SAFETY</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 2.1 Does the Factory comply with national and local health and safety laws and</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>regulations?</b></div>
<div align="left">The factory must provide a safe working environment for the workers. The building must be in good</div>
<div align="left">repair with no safety hazards. Procedures should include, but not be limited to:</div>
<div align="left">&bull; A plan for fire safety.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Adequately equipped first aid kits.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Easily accessible sanitary drinking water in work and residential areas.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Sanitary toilet facilities.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Adequate ventilation throughout building and dormitory.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Structurally sound and clean building facilities, including dormitories.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Machinery and equipment that is safe and will not cause injury to the workers.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Emergency evacuation plans, in the native language(s) of the employees, posted in view of</div>
<div align="left">factory workers (i.e. a diagram of the factory layout with emergency exits and routes highlighted).</div>
<div align="left">The factory should maintain inspection records and operating permits for building and equipment as</div>
<div align="left">required by law. This should include, but not be limited to:</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Inspection certificates and citations issued by government agencies.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Operating permits issued by government agencies.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Health and safety reports detailing findings, recommendations and corrective actions.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Machinery inspection and maintenance reports issued by factory management.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Fire extinguisher inspection records noting dates inspected and expiration.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Records of fire safety drills including the dates held and any pertinent details on the results of the</div>
<div align="left">drills.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Work injury reports including the nature and frequency of accidents.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Clinic logs listing the reason for visit.</div>
<div align="left">The factory should comply with all local and national government health requirements. Records and</div>
<div align="left">correspondence should be maintained for any on site inspections. Deficiencies discovered during</div>
<div align="left">these inspections should be recorded. The factory should correct all deficiencies and notify the</div>
<div align="left">appropriate government agency for a re-inspection. Records should be maintained of the reinspection.</div>
<div align="left">Once the factory passes the re-inspection, all documentation should be kept as evidence</div>
<div align="left">of the passed inspection.</div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 2.2 Does the Factory have procedures for machinery and equipment, and</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>chemical safety?</b></div>
<div align="left">The factory should have procedures in place for the safe operation and use of machinery and</div>
<div align="left">equipment. This should include the handling, use and storage of chemicals. These procedures</div>
<div align="left">should include, but not be limited to:</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Machinery and equipment safety:</div>
<div align="left">Training workers in the safe use of machinery and equipment.</div>
<div align="left">Providing appropriate personal protective equipment, free of charge, to factory workers and</div>
<div align="left">requiring them to use it. This equipment includes:</div>
<div align="left">Respiratory protection</div>
<div align="left">Skin protection</div>
<div align="left">Eye and face protection</div>
<div align="left">Hearing protection</div>
<div align="left">Foot protection</div>
<div align="left">Hand protection</div>
<div align="left">Head protection</div>
<div align="left">Providing appropriate safety guards and features on all machinery and equipment and ensuring that</div>
<div align="left">they are functioning properly.</div>
<div align="left">Ensuring through routine inspection that electrical equipment and outlets are not overloaded.</div>
<div align="left">Ensuring that boilers have operational pressure release valves.</div>
<div align="left">&bull; Chemical safety:</div>
<div align="left">Ensuring proper storage of hazardous and toxic materials.</div>
<div align="left">Providing periodic physical exams for workers handling hazardous materials.</div>
<div align="left">Training workers in chemical safety.</div>
<div align="left">The factory should perform the following functions to ensure that the workers are performing under</div>
<div align="left">the safest conditions possible:</div>
<div align="left">Periodically review all safety procedures to ensure that they are adequate and being followed by the</div>
<div align="left">workers.</div>
<div align="left">Develop programs and materials to train workers and managers on procedures for machinery and</div>
<div align="left">equipment and chemical safety.</div>
<div align="left">Train the workers on the use of personal protective equipment and safety guards. This equipment</div>
<div align="left">should be accessible and the workers should be required to use it.</div>
<div align="left">Store hazardous or toxic materials properly.</div>
<div align="left">Continually inspect equipment and machinery to ensure proper operation of required safety features</div>
<div align="left">and that the workers using this equipment are properly trained.</div>
<div align="left">Periodically review files to ensure required health and safety records are appropriately maintained</div>
<div align="left">and distributed.</div>
<div align="left">Require the workers to follow all safety procedures and discipline workers who do not.</div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 2.3 Has the Factory implemented procedures for fire safety which include</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>worker housing and dormitories?</b></div>
<div align="left">Fire safety is extremely important. The factory should have procedures in place that will ensure the</div>
<div align="left">workers are protected against fire and fire related hazards. This should include worker housing.</div>
<div align="left">The building and/or dormitory should have fire extinguishers placed in every room. A fire extinguisher</div>
<div align="left">should be placed within 50 feet of each worker, and be of an appropriate size that can be handled by</div>
<div align="left">the average worker. The type of fire extinguisher used depends upon the type of fire. For example,</div>
<div align="left">an area that uses electrical equipment will need a different type of fire extinguisher than an area</div>
<div align="left">where chemicals are used. All workers should be trained in the proper use of fire extinguishers. In</div>
<div align="left">addition, selected workers should receive extensive fire training and be organized as a fire fighting</div>
<div align="left">brigade. Fire extinguishers are intended for spot fires which are usually small fires. These fires can</div>
<div align="left">start by spontaneous combustion, defective or overheating machinery and equipment, careless</div>
<div align="left">smoking or other causes. Sprinkler systems, fire hoses or other fire fighting devices are intended for</div>
<div align="left">large fires, but should not replace fire extinguishers. Fire extinguishers should be serviced annually.</div>
<div align="left">Each fire extinguisher should be tagged indicating the date and type of service.</div>
<div align="left">The building should have enough emergency exits to allow the workers to leave the building in a fast</div>
<div align="left">and orderly manner. Exits should be on opposite sides of the building. If the building is more than</div>
<div align="left">one story there should be sufficient stairways to allow the workers to get to the ground floor and exit</div>
<div align="left">the building in a fast and orderly manner. A traditional fire escape on the outside of the building is</div>
<div align="left">preferred, however, any stairway that leads to the ground floor and is near an exit to the outside is</div>
<div align="left">acceptable.</div>
<div align="left">All exits should be clearly marked and accessible. Exits must not be locked or blocked in any way. If</div>
<div align="left">building security or theft is a concern then push bars should be used on the exit doors. This will</div>
<div align="left">prevent the door from being opened from the outside, but allows the door to be easily opened from</div>
<div align="left">the inside in case of an emergency. For additional security an alarm can be installed on the door to</div>
<div align="left">advise security personnel when it is opened.</div>
<div align="left">The factory should conduct periodic fire drills to ensure that all workers know how to leave the</div>
<div align="left">building in a fast and orderly manner.</div>
<div align="left">The factory should have procedures to train all managers and workers in fire safety.</div>
<div align="left">The factory should develop a fire evacuation plan. This plan should clearly define the nearest exit</div>
<div align="left">path and be prominently posted for the workers. For large buildings, several evacuation plans should</div>
<div align="left">be posted at different locations throughout the building.</div>
<div align="left">The factory should conduct periodic fire safety inspections of the building, machinery and equipment.</div>
<div align="left">Any failure of this inspection should result in immediate corrective action.</div>
<div align="left"><b>FACILITY AND ENVIRONMENT</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>Question 3.1 Is there sufficient work space for each worker to perform their duties in a</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>safe manner without interference from other workers, machinery or equipment, and raw</b></div>
<div align="left"><b>materials used in production?</b></div>
<div align="left">The factory should be designed and operated in a manner that will allow sufficient area for each</div>
<div align="left">worker to perform their duties without interference from other workers. This area should include</div>
<div align="left">sufficient space for materials, tools and other items that are necessary for manufacturing the product.</div>
<div align="left">There should be sufficient room between workers to allow them to leave their work area in a fast and</div>
<div align="left">orderly manner in case of fire or other emergency. Each work station should have adequate lighting</div>
<div align="left">to reduce the risk of eye strain.</div>
<div align="left">The factory should perform periodic inspections to ensure that the condition of each work station is</div>
<div align="left">safe and well lit. Any defective areas should be repaired or replaced as required. Work station</div>
<div align="left">inspection records and a corrective action procedure should be maintained.</div>
